# SKELLY GAMING
# Where your gaming dreams come true ðŸ’€
I just want to give credits to @razzlerazing3 and @razzlerazing for helping me with this project! I am @razzlerazing2 and I created this project with them two in order to bypass school restrictions. If you want to fork this repository, then i suggest you don't edit these files: index.js, package.json, package-lock.json, Dockerfile, SECURITY.md, render.yaml, vercel.json, webpack.config.mjs, config.js, biome.json, Masqr.js, app.json .zip, .gitignore and lastly. .replit. Just edit anything in the sixty_nine folder. Or else there will be problem with deploying, and if you're editing this and want to test it, go to Terminal, type npm install then npm run start. I just hope you enjoy this. Hide this from teachers bcuz we want freedom on our school chromebooks.
